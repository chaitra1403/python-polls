================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')
Issue: The code doesn't seem to sanitize the inputs to the SQL queries, which could lead to SQL injection attacks.
Solution: Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to avoid SQL injection. SQLAlchemy ORM also provides SQL injection protection if used properly.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: The connection details to the database might be exposed in the logs if logging level is not set properly.
Solution: Ensure the logging level is set appropriately, and sensitive information like connection details are not logged.

Vulnerability: CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information
Issue: If the configuration file mentioned in the 'engine_from_config' function contains sensitive information like database credentials, it might be stored in cleartext.
Solution: Encrypt sensitive information in the configuration files and decrypt them during runtime.

Vulnerability: CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource
Issue: The configuration file might have incorrect permissions, allowing unauthorized users to read/modify it.
Solution: Ensure the configuration files have correct permissions, restricting unauthorized access.

================================================================================
1. Scenario: Check if the function runs without any errors when the environment is properly configured.
    - Given the environment is properly configured,
    - When the `run_migrations_online` function is called,
    - Then the function should run without any errors.

2. Scenario: Check if the function creates a valid Engine object.
    - Given the environment is properly configured,
    - When the `run_migrations_online` function is called,
    - Then it should create a valid Engine object.

3. Scenario: Check if the function creates a valid connection.
    - Given the environment is properly configured and an Engine object is created,
    - When the `run_migrations_online` function is called,
    - Then it should create a connection with the context.

4. Scenario: Check if the function configures the context correctly.
    - Given the environment is properly configured, an Engine object is created, and a connection is established,
    - When the `run_migrations_online` function is called,
    - Then it should configure the context with the connection and target metadata.

5. Scenario: Check if the function begins a transaction.
    - Given the environment is properly configured, an Engine object is created, a connection is established, and the context is configured,
    - When the `run_migrations_online` function is called,
    - Then it should begin a transaction.

6. Scenario: Check if the function runs migrations.
    - Given the environment is properly configured, an Engine object is created, a connection is established, the context is configured, and a transaction is begun,
    - When the `run_migrations_online` function is called,
    - Then it should run migrations.

7. Scenario: Check if the function handles errors during the migration process.
    - Given the environment is properly configured, an Engine object is created, a connection is established, the context is configured, and a transaction is begun,
    - When the `run_migrations_online` function is called and an error occurs during the migration process,
    - Then the function should handle the error appropriately.

8. Scenario: Check if the function closes the connection after running migrations.
    - Given the environment is properly configured, an Engine object is created, a connection is established, the context is configured, a transaction is begun, and migrations are run,
    - When the `run_migrations_online` function is done executing,
    - Then it should close the connection.
