================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Potential Data Loss
Issue: The 'downgrade' function drops a table named 'polls'. If this table contains sensitive data, running this function could result in data loss.
Solution: Ensure that migrations are run in a controlled manner, with backups taken before any destructive operations such as dropping tables. Also, consider adding checks to prevent dropping tables if they contain data.

Vulnerability: Inadequate Access Controls
Issue: If the Alembic migration this code is a part of is run with insufficient access controls, an attacker could potentially trigger the downgrade and cause data loss.
Solution: Ensure that the system has adequate access controls in place to prevent unauthorized triggering of migrations. This could include requiring authentication to run migrations, or limiting the IP addresses from which migrations can be triggered.

================================================================================
1. Scenario: Check if the function successfully drops the 'polls' table.
   - Given the 'polls' table exists in the database.
   - When the downgrade() function is called.
   - Then the 'polls' table should no longer exist in the database.

2. Scenario: Check if the function handles the situation when there is no 'polls' table to drop.
   - Given the 'polls' table does not exist in the database.
   - When the downgrade() function is called.
   - Then the function should not throw any exceptions or errors.

3. Scenario: Check if the function affects other tables.
   - Given the database contains other tables apart from 'polls'.
   - When the downgrade() function is called.
   - Then only the 'polls' table should be dropped and all other tables should remain unaffected.

4. Scenario: Check if the function handles the situation when the 'polls' table is in use.
   - Given the 'polls' table is currently in use by another process.
   - When the downgrade() function is called.
   - Then the function should handle the conflict appropriately, either by waiting for the table to be free or by throwing an appropriate exception.

5. Scenario: Check if the function can be called multiple times without causing issues.
   - Given the 'polls' table has been dropped by a previous call to downgrade().
   - When the downgrade() function is called again.
   - Then the function should not throw any exceptions or errors, and the state of the database should remain the same. 

6. Scenario: Check if the function behaves correctly after the 'polls' table has been recreated.
   - Given the 'polls' table was dropped by a previous call to downgrade() and then recreated.
   - When the downgrade() function is called again.
   - Then the 'polls' table should be dropped again without any issues.
