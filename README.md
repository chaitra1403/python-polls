# Python Polls

This is a live survey/poll app.


1. Anyone can vote
2. Anyone can add an option to the poll (during a certain time period)
3. The options can just be a picture (uploaded would be nice, but even just as a link to an image URL would be okay)
4. Can use social login from Twitch or Github

Basically, let people make suggestions or requests, and then let everyone else vote on those suggestions/requests

For example. If I were to do a "Build this thing in CSS" challenge on Twitch, I'd want people to be able to suggest screenshots, and for people to vote on which one they'd like to see.
